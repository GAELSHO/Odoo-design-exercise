# Odoo Front-end Exercise

Static implementation of the mock using plain HTML and CSS.

## How to run

- Open `index.html` in a modern browser. No build step required.

## Styles

- `globals.css`: base styles, tokens (CSS variables) and utility classes (spacing, colors, radii).
- `style.css`: component and section styles (hero, navbar, card, CTA, Technology, Awards, FAQ, footer, etc.).


## Implemented

- Hero, navigation, and card mock.
- CTA bands, Technology grid, Awards cards, and FAQ accordion.

## Notes & Improvements

**Hero card relevance:** The initial credit card section feels slightly disconnected from the userâ€™s journey to purchase an Odoo subscription. It could instead highlight key product benefits, screenshots, or customer success visuals to strengthen the narrative and align with the conversion goal.
